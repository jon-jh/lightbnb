# LightBnB

LightBnB is an AirBnB clone designed to manage property rentals. It uses SQL queries to add, read, and delete information from databases. Users can create an account, log in, list properties for rent, and make reservations.

Please use npm i from the root folder to install the dependencies, then npm start local to start the server (localhost:3000 by default).

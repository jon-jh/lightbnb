# LightBnB

LightBnB is an AirBnB clone designed to manage property rentals. 

Users can:
-create an account
-log in
-log out
-list properties for rent
-see their reservations
-filter/search properties
-add a new listing (does not appear under 'My Listings' at this point since it does not cointain a rating)

Please use npm i from the root folder to install the dependencies, then npm start local to start the server (localhost:3000 by default).
